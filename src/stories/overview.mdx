## Directory Structure

In the **Universe Frontend Repository**, the components are organized into two main directories:

### `ui` Directory
The `ui` directory contains the **ShadCN components**. These components serve as the foundational building blocks for the application. They are designed to be:

- Minimalistic and unopinionated
- Highly reusable
- Configurable for various use cases

These components are typically styled using Tailwind CSS and provide the basic functionality for elements such as buttons, modals, cards, and accordions.

---

### `shared` Directory
The `shared` directory contains **custom components** built on top of the ShadCN base elements. These components are tailored for specific application needs and often include:

- Custom styles or themes to match the application's branding
- Additional logic and interactivity beyond the base ShadCN components
- Predefined configurations or compositions to streamline development

For example, a `shared` button component might wrap the `ui` button with specific styles, event handlers, or accessibility features required for the project.

## Purpose of Separation

This structure allows for a clear distinction between **base components** and **application-specific components**:
- **`ui` Directory**: Focuses on low-level, reusable primitives.
- **`shared` Directory**: Focuses on high-level, project-specific implementations.

This approach ensures:
1. Reusability of ShadCN primitives across different projects.
2. Easy customization and extension for project-specific needs without modifying the base components.

By adhering to this structure, the project maintains a clean and scalable architecture, simplifying collaboration and long-term maintainability.
