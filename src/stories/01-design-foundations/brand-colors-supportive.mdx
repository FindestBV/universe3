# Supportive Colors

Supportive color palettes, often referred to as secondary colors, play a crucial role in creating a cohesive and dynamic visual system. These colors complement the primary palette, adding depth and flexibility to designs. They are essential for highlighting specific elements, establishing visual hierarchy, and creating variation without straying from the core brand identity. Supportive palettes provide versatility for different contexts, such as accenting call-to-action buttons, emphasizing important content, or creating subtle backgrounds. By balancing primary and secondary colors, a design can remain consistent while adapting to various needs, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.
