# Visual System

Findest's visual language is a cohesive framework of design elements—such as typography, color palettes, iconography, and spatial arrangements—that work together to create a unified aesthetic and functional experience across our brand. 

It ensures consistency and clarity, allowing users to intuitively interact with interfaces while reinforcing brand identity. An integrated design system extends this concept by operationalizing the visual language into reusable components, guidelines, and tools. 

This system empowers teams to streamline development, maintain consistency at scale, and foster collaboration across disciplines. By bridging design and development, an integrated design system ensures that every element—from buttons to layouts—adheres to a shared vision, creating seamless and predictable user experiences.

## Coding standards

To help people relying on assistive technologies, like text-to-speech tools or screen reader, the components use
alternative text for assets leading to action or giving information, like links, dropdowns or call-to-actions.
